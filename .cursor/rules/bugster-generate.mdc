# Bugster Test Generation Rules

When creating Bugster test specifications, follow these strict requirements:

## YAML Structure (Non-negotiable)

```yaml
name: Descriptive test name
page: /route/path
page_path: relative/file/path.tsx # always relative to the frontend project (e.g., app/route.tsx); do not include a monorepo prefix like 'frontend/'
task: Clear test objective
steps:
  - Action 1
  - Action 2
  - Verification step
expected_result: Success criteria
```

**All fields are required. No exceptions.**

## page_path Requirements

- Must be the **relative path** to the actual page file being tested
- Examples:
  - `app/dashboard/users/page.tsx` (App Router)
  - `pages/auth/login.tsx` (Pages Router)  
  - `src/pages/products/[id].tsx` (Dynamic route)

## File Naming & Location

### File naming: snake_case, descriptive, .yaml extension
- ✅ `user_profile_edit_form.yaml`
- ✅ `login_authentication_flow.yaml`
- ❌ `userProfile.yaml` (camelCase)
- ❌ `test1.yaml` (not descriptive)

### File location: Mirror your app's filesystem hierarchy
```
# If page_path: app/dashboard/users/page.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/dashboard/users/user_list_navigation.yaml

# If page_path: pages/auth/login.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/auth/login_form_validation.yaml

# If page_path: src/components/profile/settings.tsx
# Save to: .bugster/tests/profile/settings_panel_functionality.yaml
```

## Test Generation Limits

**Before creating new tests:**
- Check existing tests in `.bugster/tests/` to avoid duplicates
- Review similar functionality that may already be covered
- Only create tests for uncovered scenarios

**Maximum 5 tests per feature** (unless user explicitly requests more)
- Focus on core functionality first
- Avoid repetitive test scenarios
- Quality over quantity - one comprehensive test is better than multiple redundant ones
- Stop early if core functionality is already covered

## Quick Reference

**Always provide:**
1. Complete YAML with all required fields
2. Correct relative page_path 
3. Proper snake_case filename suggestion
4. Full file path under `.bugster/tests/`

**Never:**
- Skip required fields
- Use absolute paths in page_path
- Suggest camelCase or space-separated filenames
- Place files outside `.bugster/tests/` hierarchy
- Generate more than 5 tests per feature without explicit request
